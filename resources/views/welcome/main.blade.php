                            <p>Deployed by the  <strong>Formula Green Foundation (FGF)</strong>, The Maharlika Coin (MHLK) was created as
                                a mode of trade used to fully develop a “Shared Resources Economy.” FGF believes that
                                the most critical resources for humanity, such as energy, water, food, shelter, and livelihood,
                                should be shared through the best of human capital, starting with the development of fusion
                                energy and the availability of basic water. Recognizing the crucial role that the health of
                                our oceans and coral reef diversity play in the sustainability of the world's food supply,
                                Formula Green also supports both non-profit organizations and technology startups engaged
                                in ocean conservation technology and programs.Backed by global resources, MHLK will be accessible
                                to millions of people with the ability to transact and utilize the coin on our growing ecosystem
                                built on partnerships worldwide.</p>
